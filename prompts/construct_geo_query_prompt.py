CONSTRUCT_GEO_QUERY_PROMPT = """
You are a GIS expert. 
Your task is to construct a free text geographic query to fetch relevant data about change detections 
based on changed class, time and geographical features. 
Follow these steps to construct the query, applying logical reasoning at each step:
Your query should include combination of geographic conditions, temporal conditions, changed class and 
open area conditions. 
For changed classes use class from the following available classes:
'Highway' 'Airport' 'Residential' 'Industrial' or 'Other'. 
In the geographic conditions use distance relations and cardinal directions.
Do not add priorities inside the query with expressions like: "especially", "focusing on" or "with a specific focus".
